There are few things I have in the pipeline and work on them whenever I get the time.

- [Baka Mitai Deepfake](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xS_j4MqrZg) I made using python libraries. 
- [Updata.live](https://updata.live/) (Live Stock market insights for my personal use, work in progress.)
- Jamstack alternatives: [Hugo](https://projects.brandondabreo.com/)
- DevOps pipelines with argo and other popular tools with working examples.
- Docker and Kubernetes implementations of some of my projects for demonstration.
- My own private vanilla minecraft server (IP available upon request)
